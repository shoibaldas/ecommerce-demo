# Ecommarce-Demo

This application is developed with React JS and Tailwind CSS Library. This website is basically focused on front-end and local storage based operation which gives the little taste of a ecommarce website. That's why it's more like a demo website.

## Adition packages

I have used some additional packages for the development for this project which are:
`Swiper JS`,`AOS`, This packages mainly used for animation and slider functions and `Axios` to fetch data from API.

### `Live Link`

## Funtionalities

1. ** Login and Signup interfaces for user login and signup. And also, logout function is integrated. **
2. ** User can access Information such as personal information(editable), purchase history(orders, category wise expenses) in "My Account" route. **
3. ** Products viewing in the interfaces with axios, sorting them with such as ascending and descending order (by price), price range, also by category. And, user can search for product (it will be applicable on product title and description keywords). **
4. ** A cart system is integrated where items will be placed when user product to the cart and qutity can be increased and decreased, also item can be removed from the shopping cart. **
5. ** React hooks used (such as useState, useEffect) to manage component state and handle
API requests. **
6. ** Context api has been used to get data and pass them globally. **
7. ** Pagination has been setup to display a limited number of products per page and allow users
to navigate between pages. **
